    An Action delegate in C# is a predefined delegate type provided by the .NET Framework that 
    represents a method that performs an action but does not return a value. It can encapsulate 
    a method that takes zero or more parameters but always has a void return type. There are 
    different variations of the Action delegate, which can take up to 16 parameters.
