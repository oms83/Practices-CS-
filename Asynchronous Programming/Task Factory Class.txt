TaskFactory Class:

﻿The TaskFactory class in C# is part of the Task Parallel Library (TPL) and is used to create and control tasks more efficiently.

TaskFactory is a class in the System.Threading.Tasks namespace that provides methods for creating and scheduling tasks.

It simplifies the process of working with tasks by offering a set of convenient factory methods.

It provides methods for creating and scheduling Task and Task<TResult> instances, thus offering more control over how these tasks are executed.
The TaskFactory class can be especially useful when you need to create multiple tasks with common configuration settings, 
such as cancellation tokens, task creation options, or task continuations.


Key Uses of TaskFactory:
Creating Tasks: Simplify the creation of tasks, especially when you have multiple tasks that share similar configurations.
Task Scheduling: Manage how tasks are scheduled for execution. It can be used to queue tasks on a specific TaskScheduler.
Continuation Tasks: Easily create continuation tasks that execute after the completion of a previous task.

When to Use TaskFactory:
When you need multiple tasks with similar configurations.
When you need more control over task scheduling.
When working with task continuations or parent-child task relationships.
