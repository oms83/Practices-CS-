In C#, EventArgs is a base class provided by the .NET Framework that is used to pass data to 
event handlers when an event is raised. It serves as a way to encapsulate event-specific data in a consistent manner.

Key Points:
Base Class: EventArgs is a base class that can be used directly or extended to include additional 
event-specific information.

Standard Event Pattern: Using EventArgs (or a derived class) follows the .NET event pattern, which helps in 
creating consistent and easily understandable events.
