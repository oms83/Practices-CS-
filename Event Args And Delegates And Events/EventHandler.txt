An event handler in C# is a method that is called in response to an event. When an event occurs, 
the event handler associated with that event is invoked to handle the event. Event handlers are 
methods that match a specific delegate signature, typically EventHandler or EventHandler<TEventArgs>.

Key Points:
Method Signature: An event handler is a method that matches the delegate signature associated with the event.

Association: Event handlers are associated with events using the += operator.
Invocation: When an event is raised, all associated event handlers are called.
